## Git Conventions

I followed the [Git branching conventions](https://medium.com/@abhay.pixolo/naming-conventions-for-git-branches-a-cheatsheet-8549feca2534) and [commit message guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as outlined in these resources. The naming convention used for the branches was:

- **Feature branches**: `feature/<feature-name>`
- **Documentation branches**: `docs`
- **Development branch**: `dev`
- **Main branch**: `main`

Commit messages were written in a standardized format, beginning with the type of change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`), followed by a concise description of the change.
